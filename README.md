    <ul><li><p>A Part-Of-Speech Tagger (POS Tagger) is a piece of software that reads text in some language and assigns parts of speech to each word (and other token), such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved (i.e. hidden) states. Hidden Markov models are especially known for their application in reinforcement learning and temporal pattern recognition such as speech, handwriting, gesture recognition, part-of-speech tagging, musical score following, partial discharges and bioinformatics.</p></ul>

  <ul><li><p>Topic modeling is a branch of unsupervised natural language processing which is used to represent a text document with the help of several topics, that can best explain the underlying information in a particular document. This can be thought in terms of clustering, but with a difference. Now, instead of numerical features, we have a collection of words that we want to group together in such a way that each group represents a topic in a document.</p></ul>

The ability to communicate with one another is a fundamental part of being human. There are nearly 7,000 different languages worldwide. As our world becomes increasingly connected, language translation provides a critical cultural and economic bridge between people from different countries and ethnic groups.</p></ul>
